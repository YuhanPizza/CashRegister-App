## Objective 🎯

This project aims to develop a Cash register Android application that performs basic operations such as buying products and stock management. I have extensively used relative layout, list view, array adapter, and intent for completing this application.

## Project Description 📝

### 1. Buy Product 🛍️

Your first activity of the cash register application UI must be similar to the activity given in Figure 1.
Features/ UI:
- header of the activity.
- product list view. For each product you have to show three pieces of information such as product name, current stock quantity, and unit price.
- another header.
- the textbox where the user gives input.
- When the user selects a product from the list view and enters the number of products to buy, you have to update these three text views accordingly.
- "Manage" button shows another activity for history and restock.
- "Buy" button performs the operation related to purchase.

### 2. Manage Activity 📊

When the user clicks on the "Manage" button in the main activity, your app will show this manage activity.
Features/ UI:
- button for showing the purchase history.
- button for restocking the product.
- button for going back to the previous activity.

### 3. Purchase History 📜

This activity is for showing the purchase history.
Features/ UI:
- header text.
- list view to show the purchased product list.
- button that is for going back to the previous activity.

### 4. Product Restock 🔄

This activity handles the product restocking.
Features/ UI:
- header text.
- list view to show the current stock.
- another header text.
- User input for the new stock value.
- Button for updating stock.
- button that is for going back to the previous activity.

### 5. Project Template Code 📦

This project is divided into two parts. In part 1, I have implemented the first activity where the user can purchase a product, and that code will be provided to you for further implementation. In part 2, I am implementing the Manage, History, and Restock Activity.
The Demonstration for the application has been uploaded to YouTube [Here](https://youtu.be/PC6FbOyQacc).
